# MyNotes

A flutter based notes app where the user can store their notes and edit or delete them whenever they want.
The notes are tied to the user's login ID so he/she has to have an account first. This enables them to view the notes on any phone.
The notes are stored in an encrypted manner in the database using fernet encryption.
User is able to share their note anywhere they want.
The notes are displayed on the order of the date and time created/edited.
The last updated time is also shown to the user.
User has the option to change their password and they have to verify their email after registration.
Firebase is used as the backend.
